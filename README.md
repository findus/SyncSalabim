# Sync-Salabim

Extremely (cringy and) minimal one-way-sync app to sync Photos to a Webdav-Endpoint.

## Sync Strategy

Has local Database that saves all successfully saved media files

Keeps data on phone after sync

On next sync just syncs new files

# TODO

- Background Sync not really working as intended 
- Implement Kind of "refresh" when database gets corrupted or is missing
